# Yahoo Finance API using Rapid API key
This HTML code is for a web application that allows users to request stock data for a given time period and download the data as an Excel file. The app includes a navigation bar with buttons for generating and downloading the report, as well as a form for inputting the start and end dates and a RapidAPI key.

The backend server is written in Python using the Flask framework. The server uses the Company and Report classes to retrieve and process the stock data, and the generate_ticker_list and save_sheet functions to create the Excel file. The server has routes for rendering the HTML template, handling form submissions, and serving the Excel file for download.
